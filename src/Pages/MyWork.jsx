            Holidaze is a venue booking platform inspired by Airbnb. I allows
            travelers to explore different venues around the world, from cozy
            cabin in the woods, to a fancy hotel by the beach. If you become a
            member, you can also create your own venue for others to checkout.
            Having this as my project for my Final Exam gave me the chance to be
            creative in different ways and it was a great learning experince.
